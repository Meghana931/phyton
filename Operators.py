 #LOGICAL OPERATORS
#In logical operators are used on conditional statements(either True or
 False). 
 #They perform Logical AND ,Logical OR and Logical NOT Operations.                                                        
 # Logical and operator
a = 100
b = 200
if a > 0 and b > 0:
    print("the numbers are greater than 0")
    # Logical or operator
a = 250
b = 1
if a > 0 or b > 0:
    print("either of numbers are greater than 0")
 #logical not operator
x = 5
print(not(x > 3 and x < 10))
#returns false because not is used to reverse the result                                                      
#COMPARISION OPERATORS  
comparison operators are also called relational operators as they find the relation between the operands 
(greater than, equal,less than,greater than equal to,less than equal to, not equal to)
and generate a boolean value in terms of True and False.
a = 4
b = 8
print(a == b)
#returns false
a = 4
b = 8
print(a != b)
#returns true
a = 4
b = 8
print(a > b)
#returns false
a = 4
b = 8
print(a < b)
#returns true
a = 10
b = 10
print(a >= b)
#returns true 
a = 10
b = 10
print(a >= b)
#returns true

1) 10,1,8,3,6,5,4,7,x,y
find general solution of x and y? write an algorithm for the same.
ans) the above series follows alternate series (i.e) even and odd numbers
     x is a variable which follows decreasing even number series
     x = 4-2 = 2   x=2
     y is a variable which follows increasing odd number series
     y = 7+2 = 9   y=9
     ALOGIRTHM:
     Step1: Start
     Step2: get x and y
     Step3: x = 4-2=2 and y = 7+2=9
     Step4: stop
